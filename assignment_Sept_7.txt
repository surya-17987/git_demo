Assignment September 7th 2022
===============================

1) Create a Bill Details class with the attributes as shown (in the image) processing the details
   from the String 
   for example 
   String transactions="19283,03-Sep-22,4500,988xx67xxx,Cash;19267,03-Sep-22,6720,988xx55xxx,CC;
19283,03-Sep-22,4500,988xx67xxx,DebitCard; ... ; ..... ; .... ;"
note individual elements are separted by , and the record is separated by ;
   You need to process the string and create object
   Store the object in 
   a) HashMap with Key being bill number, value being the bill detail objects
   b) HashSet - bill details object
NOTE let the date be in string like DD-MTH-YY"  so  16-AUG-22 or 06-JUN-22 and son
find the following:-

a) bill details with the highest bill amount and lowest bill amount
b) transaction amount done in the month of AUG
c) what are the TOTAL valued transactions the customer whose mobile number 9887767890 did?
d) How many non-cash transacion happened?
e) get a report in the following way.... (for instance)
   mobil number   No. of transactions done     Total transaction value
   9667812309             5                         12340
   9887123408             4                          8910
    ...                  ..                          ....

2) once question 1) is working then do the following :-
   given there is a Customer class with the following details ...
   9887789081,Ganesh Kumar,ganesh@yahoo.com;9554607891,Vikram Chopra,vikram.c@hotmail.com;....
   ...;....; and so on....
   create it from the String and store it in the HashMap 
   a) those customer who have tranacted the total value of 8000 and above create appropriate class
 and store it in a collection the details like
    mob number, name and email ID
   b) there could be a possibility that the mobile number is there in the transactions BUT
   it could not be there in the Customer string details - for such customers
   record it as following :-
   988778909  Info NOT available. Will collect speaking to them.
